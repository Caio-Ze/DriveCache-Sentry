# DriveCache Sentry Installation

Thank you for downloading DriveCache Sentry!

## Installation Steps:

1.  **Unzip:** Double-click the downloaded `.zip` file (e.g., `DriveCache-Sentry-v1.0.1.zip`) to extract the application. You should now see `LightMenuBarApp.app`.
2.  **Move to Applications:** Drag the `LightMenuBarApp.app` file into your main `/Applications` folder. This is the standard way to install macOS applications.
3.  **First Launch:**
    *   Navigate to your `/Applications` folder.
    *   **Important:** Right-click (or hold Control and click) on `LightMenuBarApp.app`.
    *   Select **"Open"** from the contextual menu.
    *   You will see a security warning because the app is from an unidentified developer (as it's not from the App Store). Click the **"Open"** button on this warning dialog.
    *   *You only need to do this the very first time you run the app.*

The application should now launch, and you'll see the ðŸ’¾ icon in your menu bar. After the first launch, you can open it normally (double-click, Spotlight, etc.).

## Optional: Run at Login

If you want the app to start automatically every time you log in:

1.  Open **System Settings**.
2.  Go to **General** > **Login Items**.
3.  Under the "Open at Login" section, click the **"+"** button.
4.  Navigate to your `/Applications` folder and select `LightMenuBarApp.app`.
5.  Click **"Open"**.

Now DriveCache Sentry will launch automatically when you start your Mac.
