This is a placeholder for the menubar_icon.png file.

You should replace this with an actual screenshot of the menu bar app in action.

For a proper screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your menu bar showing the ðŸ’¾ icon
2. Take another screenshot of the menu when clicked
3. Save them as PNG files in this directory
4. Update the README.md to point to these images
