# DriveCache Sentry

A simple menu bar application that monitors folder sizes on your Mac. Because in our ever-advancing technological landscape, knowing when Google Drive's cache folder silently grows to consume your storage is apparently something we need to worry about now.

It sits in your menu bar as a disk icon, doing what modern operating systems somehow still can't do on their own - tell you when folders get too big.

Set custom thresholds for any folder you want to keep an eye on. Particularly useful for that Google Drive cache that mysteriously expands when you're not looking.

It performs a daily check at 16:20. Like it or not.
